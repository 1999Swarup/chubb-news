                <b>When you think of insurance, you probably think about natural disasters. Or accidents.At Chubb, we
                    think about things differently. For us, insurance is about one thing: craftsmanship. It’s
                    who we are. It’s what we do. It’s how we serve our clients.</b>

                    swallowed an entire
                    floor of the museum, taking with it eight priceless Corvettes. By the time first responders and

                            <p>Chubb responded immediately. After engineers assessed the safety implications, Chubb made the call to allow the museum to reopen right away. By quickly granting access to the press, the museum garnered publicity around the
                                world. The amount of interest and number of visitors immediately spiked. The museum’s management team contemplated how to sustain the increased attention. Chubb’s flexibility allowed the museum to consider their options
                                and rebuild the museum with the sinkhole as part of their exhibit. It paid off. The National Corvette Museum continues to be more popular than before the now-famous sinkhole incident.</p>
