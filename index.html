                    <b>Early one morning in 2014, the National Corvette Museum needed help. Overnight, a giant sinkhole swallowed an entire
                    floor of the museum, taking with it eight priceless Corvettes. By the time first responders and museum staff arrived,
                    the cars lay smashed against dirt and rock at the bottom of a giant hole.</b>
                    <p>Chubb responded immediately. After engineers assessed the safety implications, Chubb made the call to allow the museum to reopen right away. By quickly granting access to the press, the museum garnered publicity around the world. The
                        amount of interest and number of visitors immediately spiked. The museum’s management team contemplated how to sustain the increased attention. Chubb’s flexibility allowed the museum to consider their options and rebuild the museum
                        with the sinkhole as part of their exhibit. It paid off. The National Corvette Museum continues to be more popular than before the now-famous sinkhole incident.</p>
                    <p>Cultural institutions such as museums, libraries, and aquariums face special challenges and oftentimes lack professional support. Chubb’s risk management services and tailored insurance products can help protect institutions from myriad
                        risks, both known and unknown.</p>

                        <b>Why do people choose Chubb? There’s no one answer, but there are plenty of reasons.</b>
                        <p>When you think of insurance, you probably think about natural disasters. Or accidents. Or a large stack of documents with small type. At Chubb, we think about things differently. For us, insurance is about one thing: craftsmanship.
                            It’s who we are. It’s what we do. It’s how we serve our clients.</p>
                        <p>Craftsmanship is about creating something from scratch. It’s about molding and shaping our coverage into exactly what our clients need. It’s about having the skills and expertise to figure out the best way to do the job and then
                            get it done. At Chubb, we don’t plane maple into high-end table tops or machine steel hinges and brackets. But we are craftspeople nonetheless. We combine a passion for service with deep experience and exceptional financial
                            strength to deliver the best possible insurance products for people and for businesses—big and small.</p>
